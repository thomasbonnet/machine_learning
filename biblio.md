# Some readings about machine learning

## Textbooks


* [Machine Learning, A Probabilistic Perspective](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/machine-learning-0) by Kevin P. Murphy

* [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org) by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville

* [Think Bayes](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-bayes/) by Allen B. Downey. 

* [Natural Language Processing with Python](http://www.nltk.org/book/) by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper

## Blogs
* [http://www.wildml.com](http://www.wildml.com/): Very nice blog about neural networks.
The different types of architecture are presented.
It goes from basic cases allowing to do the math by hand to present applications.
Well documented.


## Tutorials
* [Keras Tutorials](https://blog.keras.io/category/tutorials.html)
* [TensorFlow Tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/)
* [PyTorch Tutorials](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/index.html): in particular see the lstm tuto
* [In Class Kaggle](https://inclass.kaggle.com/)


## Articles

### Backpropagation

* [http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/): good introduction to the topic
* [http://cs231n.github.io/optimization-2](http://cs231n.github.io/optimization-2/): more detailed version with examples

### NLP

#### Word2Vec
* [skip-gram model](http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/)
* [TensorFlow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec)

#### Text Classifier

* [Text Classifier Algorithms in Machine Learning](https://blog.statsbot.co/text-classifier-algorithms-in-machine-learning-acc115293278): brief survey of text classifier algorithms.


## MOOC

* [udacity Deep Learning](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud730): huge gap between lectures and assignments but assigments are very informative.
