## Blogs
* [http://www.wildml.com](http://www.wildml.com/): Very nice blog about neural networks.
The different types of architecture are presented.
It goes from basic cases allowing to do the math by hand to present applications.
Well documented.


## Articles

* [Text Classifier Algorithms in Machine Learning](https://blog.statsbot.co/text-classifier-algorithms-in-machine-learning-acc115293278): brief survey of text classifier algorithms.
